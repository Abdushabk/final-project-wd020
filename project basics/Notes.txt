Hi, my name is Victor.
I come from Sri Lanka and live since 2020 in Germany.
My background is in Solar Technology  and was a General Manager for over 20 years in that industry. 
However my passion was always digital technology, and when I first started using PC's the internet was still not even created!!
It was a big change in my life to migrate to Germany, and so I decided to go on with my passion and thats why i joined this course.

Now let me welcome you all to our presentation for the WBS Coding School final project for
FS Web and App Developer course.

Over to my partner Abdu who worked together to build our final project which we are proud to present you today!
He had a super idea - now he can tell you more about it...
